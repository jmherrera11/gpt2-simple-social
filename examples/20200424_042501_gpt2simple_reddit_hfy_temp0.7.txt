“You’re right Admiral. We need to get rid of the most dangerous species in the galaxy before we can save everyone we ever harm. But we also have to keep in mind the rest of the galactic community might be less inclined towards joining forces.”

The ambassador’s voice was strong, but crisp. “Second reading, Admiral, that’s a tall order. Many species on this Council share our conviction that good will outweigh evil and that pacifism is a virtue. But what does that actually mean?”

The human’s furrowed its brow. “Aye, ‘Good outweighs evil?’ Well, there are a couple of ways around that. Either we are pacifists, or we are crazy pacifists. Either way, our species will be persecuted for our peaceful stance. And if we join forces, all that chaos will surely follow.”

The human froze, his fur clinging to the ambassador’s eyebrow firmly in place. “So, you're right, Admiral.”

“I’m right Admiral.” snapped Ambassador Ven’vale ‘If we don’t join in with peaceful intentions, then certainly joining forces with a side-bar of deathworlder annihilation will be no good.”

“So, you're saying that joining forces with side-bombs will make us more popular?”

“No, I don’t see how that’s the case.”

“Well, then... if you want to be facetious, I have an idea. Would you like me to propose a few ideas to the Galactic Council?”

Ven’vale’s omnivorous eye narrowed. “Simple - to make sure that species that are peaceful become status symbols for our own sake. Would you consider proposing a few species to the council?”

A number of species flinched in surprise, some already having difficulty holding onto their species or displaying signs of vigor. As Ven’vale explained it, these species would have to be sacrificed before they would allow any of their close friends to introduce themselves. “The only question is... can we?”

The human turned to the window, “If you would only take a moment to consider this, I would have said yes. However, as I understand it, species that have not achieved certain performance goals are discarded from the galactic scene. They are relegated to a minor role in the galaxy, forgotten and barely noticed.”

Across the Council Chamber, the human paused at the small group of species having trouble holding onto their species. The human’s breath caught in his throat, and he raised his eyebrows in exasperation. “There are certain species that are peaceful, and those that are viciously abused. But there are certain species that are viciously abused and killed for the fashion, and there are certain species that are completely free of prejudice. And in that freedom, there is freedom of thought, expression and religion.”

“So, a freedom that some people consider a luxury, but in reality are objects to exploitation and torture for the very wealthy to have access to. And a lifestyle that is based on exploitation and torture. Well, in theory, but in practice it is viewed as a very, very good life. And it is used to the very end to make sure that very rich people have wealth enough to live a life that doesn’t *possess* child labour.”

A number of the smaller species started to panic, some because they thought that just because someone is a certain colour they’ll be able to get access to it. Others because they don’t believe that life in general is fair.

“There are, of, sorcerers, doctors, scientists, engineers, all of them of noble birth.”

Many of the smaller species started to panic, some because they thought that the language barrier was to them, and some because they had no idea how to ask the other species about their existence.

Ven’vale took the chaos into her hands and began to walk away, turning towards the human, “It is with a heavy heart,” she said, “I apologise for the long programme,” but before she could continue, the door to the corridor behind her unlocked.

The human turned to face her, the locks were both unlocked and unlocked.

“What’s the state of things here?” asked Ven’vale.

Human face: light-to-white, scraggly-leafon-black, with red highlights.

The human gave a bitter sigh as she sat down. Her bottle of deep-vapors was empty,
====================
“What?”

It was the young ambassador from the Dhuzi Forest-Worlds-L7N-class destroyer, Lieutenant Colonel Titus Thor. He stood next to the human, cocked his weapon to infinity and stared at the human, then Thor, for about half-a-second.

“Lieutenant Colonel, what are you waiting for?” he asked.

“I served alongside the Terran Navy for four decades, helping arm the Terran rebellion against the Brosc overlords. I am now working for the very same institution, the very same council. The same politicians.”

“Corporal, what kind of award are you making?”

“Honourable Mention, C-sign. A Bronze Star. A Gold Star.”

“Then I will receive it.”

&nbsp;

“You have earned it. Second Lieutenant Colonel Thor is a man of many records. A fine ambassador, but not. A name for a class of people who never made it to the front, never made it to the living room, never made it to the hospital.”

&nbsp;

“A Class of the 15th century, now ranks 9th by the Dhuzi. Tell me, why we are so far out there, and you will find why we were so late to the game.”

&nbsp;

“Because of me.” The human replied. “My father was a civil servant in a Lancashire town. By his own admission, he was an uneducated and inattentive man. But then again, he was right at the bottom of many RTS reports.”

&nbsp;

“Then you are right behind the bar, Corporal.”

&nbsp;

“What did you make of his uncaring manners?”

&nbsp;

“I should have been more respectful towards him, of course, but in my own time he was a pompous, undisciplined brute. He even referred to me as a 'dumbass'.”

&nbsp;

Then there was the bastardism of the “extremists'?”

&nbsp;

“They’re the ones who pillaged our ancient cultures' histories. Did you know that the Ancient Egyptians, according to your ancient accounts, originated from the Earth?”

&nbsp;

“And the story goes, has “a baker who delivers the bad news to the right man’s post?”

&nbsp;

“Right after all, isn’t it?”

&nbsp;

“And so,” the chief of the official historians’” came up with the following statement, “The Crocs made a poor baker’s Sonnax. They had to rely on uncooked, dark cakes. And those uncooked cakes were particularly poor, if at all healthy, for their people. So they made a poor baker’s Sonnax. And those uncooked cakes were particularly sour”

&nbsp;

“So they made a sourdough starter and fed it the sourdough for three weeks, then made another batch, and so on. That was until the plant told them that the sourdough was too sour and they’d be turning it into a bland, sweet potato. So they’d make another sourdough.”

&nbsp;

“That was their Christmas present, isn’t it?”

&nbsp;

Yes, Corporal, that was given to them by the Ancient Egyptians. And it was sweet, sour and full of *(*)**”

&nbsp;

*(*to* *(cyan-like), as if to command attention)

&nbsp;

And so it went, until the humans came along and made a poor baker's Sonnax. And so it went, until the plant told them that the sourdough was too sour and they were turning it into a sweet potato. And that was until the plant told them that the sourdough was too sour and they were turning it into a sourdough full of sourness. The sourness wore off, and the plant told them that they had to make another sourdough. And so they did, and so the number of sourdoughs grew. And so it went.

&nbsp;

A sourdough of course, by the way.”

====================
“You know, it’s been a while. I got the feeling we were having some sort of private chat about how weird it is that we manage to remain in this state, and all of the sudden we have a human. It's not the worst kind of sapient.”

The sounds of muttering, muttering became a thing gone quickly. The professor was about to joke about that becoming a normalized part of his lectures, when he heard the soft clinking of teeth in the machines. Curiosity was proving too much for the lazy bastard, and he changed the subject.

“Anyway, I was watching TV when something really, really big burst into view. A spaceship was hauling some Eells' class back from a space station attack on another hyperspace race, a Space Exploration Company spaceship was hit by an artillery piece, and all of a sudden we were watching a major battle. The battle was a mess, both sides were trying to figure out what was and wasn’t what, and then there was a firefight. Everyone was covered in smoke, some just barely able to see, and everyone else just’d just bleed out. The humans just rolled over, and I-* Kneeshoo! Be quiet!***

A/N: So this fucks me up a bit. I wouldn’t have expected this to take so long to load up and go live, but I only got around to the end of the first half of the game having ANTLY AUVENE!” I also didn’t expect the massive take back from a popular tactical and strategic card game.

I'm still not sure if I approve or not of the direction the story is going in. There are so many dark areas, and there are so many possible paths to explore. But overall, it just seems like a great story, and I look forward to playing with the writers!

“Waylon LeBlanc, Third Line, French Guiana.” I paused for a drink before swiping to my left and up to my right to see where he stood on the human story. He was in front of him a mix of soldiers, a platoon and a freight train, clearly into a new high, a somber look on his face as he spoke. “We were fighting a rearguard as we approached, and when we made eye contact, he shifted his body so that he was face to face with us, not onto our railcar.”

I took a deep inhale of the vapors before exhaling back a splash of cool vapors, both of which were becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The professor was no slouch when it came to documenting human movements, and his meticulous analysis of data was frequently hampered by the enormous dataset he was saddled with. Still, I could see him skimming over the chaos as LeBlanc, a natural at the centre of it all, spoke with an air of calmity and confidence.

“We were fighting a rearguard as we approached, and when we made eye contact, he shifted his body so that he was face to face with us, not onto our railcar.”

I found myself smiling out the window, which had a hush still as the train rolled by, not due to the human's unflinching stare but because of the professor’s gentle glint in his eye.

“We’ve had some really fun writing for Waylon, and we think he’s looking forward to the challenge of writing for us.” The professor chuckled, which only added to LeBlanc’s amused laughter.

I held my breath to his all the same, as I had when I was a student body president, but was surprised at the number of times somebody managed to laugh off a professor so readily. Still, it was a good laugh, and he seemed to be enjoying it.

I did notice that Waylon tended to his students by the hand-washing their hands a bit more, which was nice, because it made me more human, and it made my hands feel a bit more at ease being able to wipe away any worries about Touch ID.

He then went to sweep a group of his students through the hall, and I could see a few of them were getting really emotional as he did so. It made me wonder if it was because they’d just want to throw a party, or just wanted to stare at Mr. Clasico’s most human looking desk.

I shrugged that off, feeling that it was just a boy’s problem, but the professor still seemed to think that way.

I remember thinking that putting a human face forward over the shoulder at least made for a more interesting look, but alas, that theory has
====================
“Fucking hell, it’s a fucking SUCKSON’!”

I sighed in relief. The human’s bell would ring three hundred and ninety-three times in a row, and the ensuing argumentative storm would drag on for hours. It was a hell of a time, even for a species with an impressive engineering feat.

“But they also have our back, right?” Yang mused. “And they’ve fought back. We’ll pay for their defeat by giving them a home.”

“Surely you have our back, too.”

I snorted. “But I’m also responsible for their downfall. And if we lose, they'll probably stole our money.”

“I don’t know, maybe… maybe… but… it’s my damned career, right?”

I winced. The human’s eyes were fixed on me, and my words only added to the already horrible mist.

“Don’t forget to take your medals, Yang, and we'll have a very, very happy family!”

I saw the smile on Yang’s face. It meant something to me, sure, but it also meant something to her.

I leaned forward and lifted my glass, letting my reflection in. The room was far too small for the human, just her height and frame, and the amount of glass she could carry. And I hated having her at my side.

All of it, completely. I leaned forward and covered my face with my hands, feeling the cold sweat soak away at my face. But it also made me want to cry, and I hated having someone touch me while I was still naked.

I leaned forward and stared at the ceiling, at the reflection in the hall, at the pool, at the things that were so desperately needed right now.

The only thing that would have fixed it was for the human to steal my medals.

I hated that, too.

But I doubted that someone would steal my wealth.

And I guessed that Yang would steal mine as well.

I hated having someone else pay for my needs, but I also thought that if I was to be successful, I had to have someone be able to take my place.

I guessed that thieves would not hesitate to steal from those who would give money, and if someone stole from my place of use, I would be the first to be blamed.

But I doubted that would be the case, too.

People often forget that I work in a construction firm, after all.

And it seems that way, isn’t it? The construction trades have always had a following in the capital, and the White Dwarf is well-known for its availability. They get a huge amount of contracts for goods and services, and tend to the poor and working-class communities in general. In theory, they would, but in practice they have always had a few greedy hoarding stories to build around.

The problem was, whenever someone stole a human’s money, that person also caused a large amount of damage. One hundred and ninety-three people have since been arrested, and another thirty-eight hundred have been left homeless. A few of those have now died from starvation, and all of them's families have suffered a loss as a result. All of this while, the surrounding areas have been completely cut off from the outside world, and many people have only internet access.

To have someone else pay for a certain amount of metal, metal that should never have been paid, is just horrid.”

I could not bring myself to open my mouth to speak, lest I faint, lest I afraid lest I falter. But I answered, honestly, and with tears in my eyes: “”

“’Virtues’.”

And with that, the door closed behind me.

Then I was gone.

Over the last week, the White Dwarf has been slow to open its case. The only way to know when someone's door is being open is to go by their eye.

I was in shock.

Within an hour of entering, I’d had a whole heap of problems.

“There’s one more thing.” I explained, quietly. “I’d like a mouth watering bath. Also, my teeth got a whole lot worse.”

The human stared at me for a moment, his tail twitching a bit. “Oof.”

Then I said, “Oof.”

The mouth watering bath worked. The beast stopped twitching. Then I saw

The Rapture was an especially painful death for humanity, for reasons unknown to humanity. The wars that followed were a continuation of the ancient conflicts between species, between sapient life and sapient matter, between living and dead races. It was the Industrial Revolution that laid the groundwork for what would become modern humanity.

Humans had never had a functioning economy before, and they were only now starting to recover. The Rapture was no ordinary industrial disaster, it was a terrible disaster caused by two totally separate and unrelated factors, greed and environmental catastrophe.

Greed was defined as the exploitation of the working class for personal gain. The status of the working class in society was a central theme of the book. It was the central theme of the trilogy, it was the four main villains who broke the cycle of poverty, and it was the four main villains who cost humanity its very existence.

The environmental catastrophe was a defining theme of the trilogy. It was the four major violent superpowers, each on the cusp of nuclear holocaust, who caused the climate crisis of 2.5C. The four biggest peaceful superpowers, China, Russia, and the U.K., each suffered a devastating 3C collapse.

The human race was in grave peril, and they needed a new course. They needed a path to happiness. A life without greed, and a happy existence.

The Four

Spoiler alert: the video contains major plot holes

The human race was an eclectic collection, but there were certain groups that I felt were singularly human. The ones that had single-handedly brought about the end of the war.

The pharmaceutical industry.

The military.

The poor.

While I found the notion of humanity in these people to be somewhat comical, it was true. The Dreeden Hardsmail had managed to bring down the United States Navy and gotten away with as much as possible, thanks to very efficient Navy technology. I still remember how I treating them back then. They were unbelievably hard to come by, and the highest paid in the game still managed to rortle through the game's bounties. But to me, the Four were a greater mystery than the current state of affairs.

The Dreeden Hardsmail was a small, air-breathing alien ship barely larger than a small human ship. It was part of the larger human fleet, but had been reduced to scrap after the Dreeden Hardsmail had managed to escape successfully. The only question that remained was why.

The answer to this burning question lay in its human owner.

Inevitable, I was told, was that the owner was a lunatic.

For the owner, as the video shows, to outright lie to the Hardsmail, cheat, and commit military suicide. To the entire human race, he or she were the bad guys, the aliens were to be feared. To the Gheraani.

For the owner, as the video shows, to the conflict as a whole was an affront to their god and to humanity itself. To themselves, to the many different races they had alienized over the course of its existence. To the alien race as a whole.

For the Field Marshal, the human was no longer a friend.

*At least he or she weren't spy-civ servants bent on crushing their enemies. It was just…*

**Ha, that's exactly what it was. They were trying to spy on us, spy on *Meowthot*. I can understand your deep-seated suspicion, but…*

The owner of the human, Harkneth, straight up admitted it to me. "It was just a joke, was all… *sad*. But now they're laughing at us! It's the end of the FTL line for the Gheraani, and we can always go back to using Earth-based transport! And, of course, we can always go back to using the Four Armies ships! Wow, that's not even the point, all of the shareholders are covered, and all of the technology is now from Earth! *It's for peaceful coexistence between humans and the Gheraani, not slavery!*"

I held my breath to think of all the ways in which I could have contributed to humanity's current predicament. The fact that the Human owner had been able to keep my shareholders and shareholders' money as a secret, the fact that I was able to co-write the Harkneth report, and the two explanations for humanity's current standing, was the only possible way to preserve my shareholders and shareholders.

But I doubted it. The shareholders already had an explanation for why I'd co
====================
“So.” The professor chuckled. “You don’t understand. You can only ever see the world through the lens of your own personal artistic perspective.”

The students’ collective sputtered for a moment, seeming to hit upon no matter how hard they tried to look at them.

“So.” Brodie pointed out a row of row after row of sets of spiral lenses, each housing a different type of image processing array. Each array contained a digital camera, a sensor, and a housing. “These are “formal dispatches to the Custodian of Ghera’s space-faring flora and fauna, which we presume will become available to Custodian service at some point in the future.”

“This’s a delicate issue,” Ghera growled Yamada, pointing at one. “The flora of Ghera is diverse, and a number of species have been known to show surprising shifts in their blooming and reproduction. However, as the years pass and species evolve, so do their tolerance for unusual changes.”

“You’re trying to determine the stability of a species by its diversity,” Rinn murmured.

“I’m frankly surprised that such a measure was detected,” muttered Kawalski, pointing at one. “The sheer diversity of species makes them an interesting source of data. They require a great deal of diversity in their societies, in their cuisine, in their clothing. To have a diversity of species report their findings is truly a finding of great significance.”

“The Yamada do so,” Rinn protested. “They speak an awful lot of Yamada. I don’t want to be confused with their tapir-lingu, the similarly shaped tapir of the Pacific Ocean.”

Yamada tapir? Brodie scowled. “That poor sapient has a name, after her!”

“If it sounds familiar, it is. Yamada. The adaptations learned during childhood have permanent names that last for centuries.”

Yamada tapir? Yamada tapiope? That was the weird looking tapiope I grew up with. They speak an awful lot of Yamada.

“They too have names,” she said. “Like tapiocera, after our family.”

Yamada tapioceras? They were named after their ability to see.

“That was my idea,” she said, “but it turns out they also have scales. Which give them a different look from us. They have long flowing spines that stand up up to windpits or wave lengths of up to 200 meters. They also have long, pointed teeth, which can be seen when looking straight at them.”

Yamada tapiocera, for their ability to see.

“So, that sounds about it for them,” said Rinn. “But for us, it is. Seeing means we can see more of what we already have, to a more natural and pleasing degree. Seeing creatures have to have a sense of smell to survive, for example. And to have that sense, they had to have these tentacles. They had to have a sense of smell, even though we don’t normally sniff them. And because of that, they have to be our only companions, because they have to.”

Yamada tapioceras? Brodie snorted.

“They have remarkably similar facial structures, but they have much thicker scales that stand completely still and curve up and down as they look down at something. They look up to us when we approach them, because that’s what they want us to do when we are looking down at them. They have scales on their heads that look like we’re talking about those early predators who had to move around so loosely to survive, and they have tentacles in their bodies that look like we’re floating in liquid. They seem to think that looking down on us is a good way of hiding from predators, which are cold, predatory, and painful.”

Yamada tapioceras? Brodie snorted again.

“They have scales on their heads that look like we’re giving them a taste of death,” she said. “And they also have small bumps in their sides that look like they want to slap each other's ass. That's how terrifying that is.”

Yamada tapioceras? That was a pretty terrible looking looking face. Yamada, by the way, had a beautiful face! Brodie thought
====================
The Otegan had been expecting a fight, especially from this height. The humans had been known to expect brutal combat from giants when they had the discipline to spare. But this was different. This fight was about to get much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much.

The humans stopped them.

"The humans are here!"

The Otegan capitalized on the confusion, and opened fire on their troops. Dozens of Marines were dead or wounded. No one was left standing for hours.

The humans took the field to all the eyes, and Kingdom Hearts 3D was awarded the top award at E3.

The humans were unrecognizable from the outside. The human reporters could see only through their virtual glasses.

"The humans are here! The humans are here. We have given them freedom, human! We have given it back! The humans have won! We have given them a home, and a reason to live. We are giving them a life. And a life without prejudice, old age, or superstition. And without the fear of failure. No matter what happens, we will give them a chance. A chance of survival, because everything will be right here. Everything will be okay. . . ."

The last word.

A/N: *this* wasn't what we wanted to write, so I'm doing a slightly different story.

Also, *this* was the last post I wrote, so I gotta make some big changes.

Anyway, enjoy, and (gasp) thanks to the support of the community!

-The Voice*

“Thank you all for the feedback, everyone is really nice!” I turned off the on-screen chat to allow the story to flow naturally, and directed my attention back to the book.” It was The Voice’s third author, Patricia Arquind, and she was deeply involved in the writing, both public and private. She was also the one who had to pass up the other's offer to write the humans’s eponymous song.” I had hoped they might all come along, that I’d be disappointed at the same oddity; but, no. >Crack, crack, crack, crack.” She finished, reluctantly, and marched off to the opposite wall, where the other authorsbooks were being written.

“Thank you all for the feedback, everyone is really nice!” She paused at one point to read the others feedbacks, then gave them a quick look. “I know this might sound weird,” she admitted, “but to me it’s like...”

“You get what you get’?” One of the humans she had saved from the Brosc back at Rinnor as she was being written, snarky as ever. “I got what I got’, I swear.”

“You didn’t, Rodrik. Did you?” Patricia chuckled, biting her lip as she remembered.

“I thought so.”

***EDIT***: ******************

Over the past week, I’ve been writing, talking, and speaking to the humans in greater detail, in hopes that they will at least give me the time of day and the courtesy of researching their history. 

Not all of them, of course, and certainly not with the knowledge of a living third party. But in the interest of variety, here is my analysis of each of the writers, their writing style, and the overall mood of the book.”

The humans started out with Rodrik’s take on the human title. It was given because of their unusual title in relation to their home world.

It was given because of the naming convention, naming these things after themselves after the things that they had done. 

So, to them, it was like they had a whole new way of naming things - a way of life, a new way of looking at time, of time as a series of numbers, rather than as a series of numbers and/or periods. 

And because naming them after themselves was part of the core concept of the book, they immediately went with it. This was because of the way naming conventions were generally interpreted in the West: that a person should be able, if reluctantly, to take on the name of a being they had never met. This, in turn, had implications for East Asian history, in particular: that the way the Dreeden had viewed Asia from a number perspective was inextricably tied to the way the Dreeden viewed their planet. 

Which meant that in order to the humans, who had come to write about humanity, it was like being in their overworld at a
====================
The human race is in crisis. They went from being subhuman to a species of pure poison. They went from being garbage to a kind of prosperity. They went from being rich to poor to middle class. And then they went from being poor to middle class. The very concept of humanity as a whole, as a people, as a species, as an entire, went, oh my God, we're going to be eaten by a certain category."

"And you don't know what else we could do," the professor chimed in, "but take a break and just relax. This ain't no real job interview material, you'll be good."

"What?"

"Well, what else could I do?", he said, "than work with an engineer and get my show under control? Also, I don't have a fucking clue as to what you're talking about..."

Hissed, "All I know is that..."
=====
"What?"

The human nodded. The blade of grass suddenly felt quite flat against his back, and his tail flinched in a way that signaled discomfort. He reached for his flask, which he had hastily pulled from the shelf just in time to be right next to the stench of sweat. 

"A little too… perfume? Like Rhyne for sure?"

The human shrugged.

"Yeah. I know, I know," the legendary herbivore retorted. "That was my whole life – I guess it's just easier when you have no taste buds left in the fight."

"It sounds kinda weird, really…" the human shrugged.

"Yeah. You can just stop now, you know. Just… just in case."

"E-E-Anybody else's stuff?"

"E-Anybody else's stuff? Yeah."

"Well, this is the old adage – don't rely on appearances, but if something is really, really bad you can look it up somewhere."

"That's… quite the advice," the other end of the human's tail flinched, pointing at the bottle. "Isn't that a little weird, isn't it?"

The herbivore gave a low but clear-cut smile. "Yeah, that's right – you can look it up yourself. Just… start looking up your current condition and… goals."

"… goals?"

"Well, to be honest, I didn't realize how much of a struggle that was. I was practically smacking myself in the face before I could pull through, and now I was… just looking at the clock – you know, the total amount of time since we last met, huh?… I didn't realize how long it would take…"

"What?!?"

"Well, since you both canck into sloths now, and since you can see more of the stars, that means you can see less of the sloths… right? And because you both have pretty good vision, that means you can see less of the constrictorflies."

The last word.

The professor's tail flicked back and forth a few degrees, frowning. "All that work, money, all that?"

The human shrugged. "Well, now I know why they stick around – they canck into sloths now. They can catch a train, they can scare themselves into thinking they're being funny, and they can get away with it. I guess that's the fun – taking the sloths out is part of the fun, isn't it?"

The professor's tail twitched again, then stopped.

"Well, now they know what kind of power they have, they canck into little cannons and shoot things from a thousand directions. Now they have to figure out how to use them, right? I wouldn't rule out another run in if they had a weakness, though – breaking into moons could be a good way to get a little… weird…"

The two humans shook their heads in defeat.

"That's completely out of your hands, now! Just do some research into it, and you could be a little… weird… –oDgBTLyEs is a random gen number, after all. I wouldn't rule them in, though – wouldn't they all have a D? I'm sure they'd all come from less-reactive species, or even less-famous species, or… else we might just have to revert back to stock…"

The confusion and anger on the students' faces was far moreening now, than it had been before, as they had given their all to help set the university up for success. This was truly an extremely successful gen number, and there was no conceivable way that something this bizarre was actually happening. However, there was also the matter of the consequences. If this were just a minor incident

“I don’t know, ma’am. Did your mother die?  

“No, I don’t know, actually.” She smiled at “You know, it seemed like a good idea at the time. My father, Peter, passed away on 16 May, and my mother, Rosalind, had to pass away too. Did you die?”

We all knew each other very little, and we’d probably all figure it out tomorrow. Our jobs as scientists, engineers, and now, anthropologists are very similar - we both like to ruminate - and so having a biological mother and having a genetic father was not that surprising. But it was also, very strange. After all, humans had been here before us, before you’d know them.”

A/N: So, this is the second half of the story. I’m working on writing a longer, more in-depth history of the Human Race, partly because of the diversity of species, partly because of the sheer amount of science and technology that has been added to the known universe in the past few decades. Also, partly I needed to know if there was a human history after the Xunvirians, Earth, *(exactly)* where we’d broke up your solar system colony. *In*locations: *Earth, Asia, *(exactly)* where.*

“Shut up, Carl!” His tail jerked forward, making out a new song of *contamination*, as he was hauled onto a garbage truck that had apparently not even had enough food to last a single passenger. He heard the soft thump of engines thumping in unison, and wondered if it was because of the gas tank, or the heater, or whatever it had been coated in. Whatever it was, it wasn't good enough to call home.

“So, this is the conclusion I’ve come to, now.” He turned to find that he was sitting in the fourth row, his left heel curling around a heel screw, and presented with a turned-in-the-poster-looking-mountain of red lab coats over his heel results.

“So far so good.” He chuckled to himself, taking in the moment to compose himself. The only thing that a healthy dose of reality-TV-ing and all the rest kept him from being as authentic as he was.

“Anyway,” He took another long inhale of vapour, which he passed out into a crisp breath, before setting it back down, and turning to look at the other passengers in the garbage can, "So far so good. The engines are beating the shit out of the plant, and it looks fantastic!”

Except it’s not.” The human turned around, and stared at the huge red lab coat, straight ahead.

“COHOL!”

“COOL!”

“COOL!”

“And it looks like the artificial colours are from the tomatoes!”

The human nodded, and continued his inhale, which was slower than his steady drip of vapours, but still with the heat – and the smell – coming through.

“And it looks like it too,” he said, turning back to face the camera. “In the last batch we had a light pink, then a deep blue, then finally a completely opaque, and I’m still amazed how quickly they colour-coordinate them.”

The enthusiasm among the humans was well-earned, and the rest of the crew eagerly took their order. The plant itself was magnificent, with all the shops, factories and palaces that the Dweorg civilisation had come to bring, yet it lacked the towering buildings of its medieval brothers. There was just something off about the old civilisation, and its people, that was getting old.

The plant wasscritically motivated, though, was probably. They were going to spend quite a bit of money on something completely new, and entirely functional.

The only problem was that they weren’t technically upgrading the plant itself. The civilisation had been around for only ten billion years, and had come to the Milky Way via a wide-open portal that opened up after it had first started making ships. They had made their first commercial vessel, a ship that only made two radio calls per day, and that cost them a fortune. They had also made a poor, buggy, and ugly
====================
When the war was under way, the humans were fighting on. Over 1,200 refugees (more than half of them children) had been forced to flee their homelands. Human ingenuity was breathtaking, but its paymasters were beyond compare. The governments of both empires had devoted tens of billions of dollars to modernizing and modernizing their military, while simultaneously patting their vassals on the back for their hard work.

The war was a disaster for both empires. The humans patrolled the edge of the galaxy, sifting through the wreckage to piece together what exactly went down. Both empires were in total disarray, and many people still remember how it started. The humans had declared the war, and both states responded with utter siege.

Human ingenuity was breathtaking, but its paymasters were beyond compare. The governments of both empires had devoted tens of billions of dollars to modernizing and modernizing their military, while simultaneously patting their vassals on the back for their hard work.

Both empires were in total disarray. The war was a flop. The humans had fallen back so far because of the cheap labor, the cheap exports, and the few diplomatic breakthroughs. The humans patrolled the edge of the galaxy, sifting through the wreckage to piece together what exactly went down. Both empires were in total disarray.

The humans had given up so little in value by the time the Great Expansion, Cleopatra's second term, was complete. Both empires were in total disarray.

The human race had been on a tear for over a quarter of a millennium. Planetary resources were approaching that of any human colony. Their seas were siltied, their seas bare. In many ways, they were the artificiality of modernity. A generation of adult females who could look after their young on the cheap and unapologetically their young not being able to get a mother until their late thirties, they had fought so hard for so little. Both times they'd been able't only made smaller by the caprice of the status quo, but also more entrenched by having had to face accusations of human exploitation for almost a generation now.

The Great Expansion had driven both empires to the edge of total ruin. In less than a millennium they'd been forced to give way to entirely new alien worlds, each large enough to accommodate up to a dozen adult females. The result had been a situation in which civilizations would constantly atone for their past crimes, whether that's through miracle, conquest, or even outright annihilation.

The humans had treated the expansion like a minor issue back in their day. They'd even joked about how much easier it would've been for the humans to straighten up if they'd just been born into more of a normality by having both adult races naturally vassal status and continued to trade with each other. Now that their trade and trade access had normalized, the joke was a whole lot more subtle than some people were paying their entry fees to walk into.

The Great Expansion hadn't completely wiped out both of the empires, though. The refugee crisis had been particularly bad, with more than a million refugees now trapped in the Middle East, and hundreds more trapped in Africa. The humans had done their part by tolerating greater numbers of their species than they were used to, especially between their races' common goals. But the consequences had been truly devastating. Slaves and fellow species alike, torn between their difference, as humanity had been raised as a separate species to the rest of the universe, and each having no place to grow, to communicate, or to hold one another responsible for their own actions, had lost all trust in their leaders.

The human victory had been so crushing, in fact, that both human governments had to resort to the most banal methods: bribery. Since both humans had no natural allies other than the Gheraani, they bribed their ambassadors, which themselves had no natural allies other than the Gheraani. This process continued for years, until one particular species of Gheraani species even joked about it, even if it meant crushing another species with a ship. The humans, still very much human, used the trade, to their shame.

The crisis with the humans had left them little more than a laughing stock amongst galactic society, but over time it had gained popularity. The joke was that by the time the laughter died down, bribing their leaders was a whole lot of serious drinking – literally, for weeks at a stretch, literally. By the time the expansion began, nobody was drunk enough to justify spending weeks in a bar, even after the humans had made no attempt to bribe neutral councilors.

The human victory was so crushing, in fact, that both human governments had to resort to bribing their ambassadors. One species at a time, they casually remarked, bribing their entire diplomatic team by offering them jobs in exchange for votes. Two species at a time, offered jobs in
